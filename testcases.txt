This File in particular explains in detail about how our program operates as per the guidelines with one client or even multiple clients. It also explains in detail how we tested our code to be fully functional according to the guidelines of the assignment. 

--> What is the purpose of the assignment?
	
	-To implement our own version of git which is a a popular current iteration of a series of version control systems. To build a server and a client to maintain all the necessary changes form server to client and vice versa.

All the testcases written below are tested on the ilab machine named "ls.cs.rutgers.edu" with IP address = 128.6.13.171 and Port number = 17000.

/////
Below the Testcase the change in ".manifest" file is shown.
\\\\\

Test Cases:

	- Following are the different command line interfaces we tested for the files named file1.txt, files2.txt and file3.txt in the project named TESTCASE. The required files will be created when you run "make test" and then run the executable named "WTFtest". 
	-The output of following testcase are according to the guidelines as mentioned in the assignment.
